Because this project is intended to be used as a specimen or example to test and/or
demonstrate the functionality of Software Composition Analysis and Software Bill Of 
Materials related software, it must by its nature also include software components
from other authors, each of which include and are covered by their own copyrights, 
licenses and conditions. Many of these licenses will, by design, be more restrictive 
than the license included with this software. 

While this project is intended to be released freely to Public Domain, the included 
license does NOT (and generally can NOT) superceed or replace any licenses covering
any additional components used in this project. 

The author(s) of this software make no claims regarding the suitability or permission
to use any additional components included in this project for any purpose beyond its 
inclusion here, and will not be held responsible for any violations of licenses 
which cover those additional components. 

You are advised to review any and all additional licenses covering the components 
used in this software (ideally with someone qualified to give that advice)
